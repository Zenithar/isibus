= Control Center =

Messages triggered by the ControlCenter :

|| Protocol || Params || Class || From || Description ||
|| `Bus_([0-9]+) Start` || instance_id || BusStartMsg || Bus || Sended by the bus process, give to all its instance number ||
|| `Bus id=([0-9]+) line=([0-9]+) pos=([0-9]+),([-]?[0-9]+) capacity=([0-9]+) speed=([0-9]+)` || int, int, int, int, int, int || BusPositionMsg || Bus || Send his position by giving the road id, and the distance on it. Positive distance means the bus is going away, and negative means it's coming back. And the capacity of the bus at the moment. Finally the instant speed.||
|| `Station_([0-9]+) Start` || instance_id || StationStartMsg || Station || Sended by the station process, give to all its instance number. ||

= Bus =

Messages triggered by the Bus :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||
|| `Bus_([0-9]+) id=([0-9]+) passengers=([0-9]+) line=([0-9]):(([0-9]+,[0-9]+;)*)` || instance_id,int,int,int,string || || CC || Initialise the bus process, with control center data. Send the internal bus id, its capacity, and the affected line. ||
|| `Station id=([0-9]+) bus_id=([0-9]+) len=([0-9]+)` || int, int, int || || Station || The station send his position, relative to the bus position on the common road portion. ||

= Station =

Messages triggered by the Station :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||
|| `Station_([0-9]+) id=([0-9]+) road=([0-9]+) lines=([0-9]+(,[0-9]+)*) len=([0-9]+)` || instance_id, int, int, string, int || || CC || Synchronize the station process with the control center data. ||

= GUI =

Messages triggered by the GUI :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||


= Scenario =

We have 3 bus process, 3 stations, 3 lines.
