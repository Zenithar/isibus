= Control Center =

Messages triggered by the ControlCenter :

|| Protocol || Params || Class || From || Description ||
|| `Bus_([0-9]+) Start` || instance_id || BusStartMsg || Bus || Sended by the bus process, give to all its instance number ||
|| `Bus id=([0-9]+) line=([0-9]+) pos=([0-9]+),([-]?[0-9]+) capacity=([0-9]+) speed=([0-9]+)` || int, int, int, int, int, int || BusPositionMsg || Bus || Send his position by giving the road id, and the distance on it. Positive distance means the bus is going away, and negative means it's coming back. And the capacity of the bus at the moment. Finally the instant speed.||
|| `Station_([0-9]+) Start` || instance_id || StationStartMsg || Station || Sended by the station process, give to all its instance number. ||

|| gui id=([0-9]+) delete||  int || || gui || Delete the bus ||
|| gui route_id=([0-9]+) pbciruclation||  int || || gui || Blocked road ||
|| CC Station Path=([0-9]+):([0-9]+) || int, int || || gui/bus || Calculate a path between  two station. ||
= Bus =

Messages triggered by the Bus :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||

|| `Station id= ([0-9]+) bus_id= ([0-9]+) len= ([0-9]+)` || int, int, int || || Station || The station send his position, relative to the bus position on the common road portion. ||

= Station =

Messages triggered by the Station :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||
|| `Station_([0-9]+) id=([0-9]+) road=([0-9]+) lines=([0-9]+(,[0-9]+)*) len=([0-9]+)` || instance_id, int, int, string, int || || CC || Synchronize the station process with the control center data. ||
|| gui getTimes station id= ([0-9]+)|| int, int || || gui || Ask information about station ||

= GUI =

Messages triggered by the GUI :

|| Protocol || Parameters || Callback Class || From || Description ||
|| `Station id= ([0-9]+) time=(( [0-9]+, [0-9]+;)*) status=(( [0-9]+, [0-9]+;)*)`  || int, [int, int]+ || || Station || Send the information from bus traffic to the GUI, & CC. ||
